# MoreLoves

A simple 2D game to play during time when you need to relax after a deep coding time. On your lovely terminal,
use your keyboard keys to navigate and chase for more loves. You can even chase for bullets to increase your budget. 
Remember that only the accuracy of your cursor's position is the key to succeed at this lovely game.

Enjoy :)
